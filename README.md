# Spreadsheets Are Not Databases (SAND)

## Problem
Over the years I have seen many companies and/or teams to use huge spreadsheet for something that databases are better.
Spreadsheets shine at presenting data and not as much as analyzing, storing and manipulating them, for that databases have a better use case.
SQLite and DuckDB makes it seemless to work on databases and native LLM capabilities on Jupyter Lab can give us insights and boost our productivity.

## Obstucle
Most people's obstacle is how to transfer the data from a spreadsheet to a database and how to use SQL afterwards to manipulate and analyze the data.

## Solution
The purpose of this repository is to make it seamless to transfer data from a spreadsheet to a database. Furthermore the use of LLM will allow the user to use natural language to query the Database and export the results to spreadsheets and/or graphs.


## Goals:

1. Transfer data from spreadsheets to a Databases (DuckDB, SQLite, PostGres, etc)
1. Add Jupyter support
1. Add LLM support
1. Allow exports to spreadsheets or other formats.
