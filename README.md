## Spreadsheets Are Not Databases (SAND)

Over the years I have seen many companies, teams or groups to use huge spreadsheet for something that databases are better.

Most people's obstacle is how to transfer the data from a spreadsheet to a database.
This repository's goal is to make it seemless to transfer data from a spreadsheet to a database.


## Goals:

1. Transfer data from spreadsheets to a Databases (DuckDB, SQLite, PostGres, etc)
1. Add Jupyter support
1. Add LLM support
